<p style="font-size: 24px;">The word 'Kongu' refers to a region of the southern state of India and the term 'Kongu Vellalar' specially means the agricultural community, predominated in the west of Tamilnadu, which was deprived of educational facility in those days. To achieve technical excellence in their rural areas, 41 philanthropists from different walks of life who realized the need for technical education for their region's economic strides, formed collectively a Trust called 'The Kongu Vellalar Institute of Technology Trust' and they tried to promote and develop equality of opportunity for the rich and the poor.

Affiliated to Anna University Chennai,the college has completed more than three decades of dedicated service to the people of India 
and abroad in the field of Technical Education. The Institution has an area of 167 acres of land richly endowed with beautiful greeneries. 
The college with its state-of- the- art infrastructural facilities and excellent academic records has earned recognition as one of the reputed educational 
institutions for men and women in India.</p>
